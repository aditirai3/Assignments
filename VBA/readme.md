VBA Exercise

Created a VBA script for an excel that contains stock info (ticker, open price, close price and volume for one year) across 3 years (2014-2016) 

Analyzed the info as follows:

  * Looped through all the stocks to return unique ticker symbols.

  * Calculated yearly change of each stock for a given year.
  
  * Highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red through conditional formatting.
  
  * Calculated percent change for a given year.

  * Returned total stock volume of each ticket for a given year.
  
  * Created another summary table with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
